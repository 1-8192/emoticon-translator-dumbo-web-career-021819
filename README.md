# Emoticon Translator

## Background

You've started to notice that your cool friend, who has been living in Japan for a couple months, has been texting with odd emoticons that you don't recognize, like `＼(◎o◎)／!` and `((d[-_-]b))`. You've decided to be cool like him by texting with these expressive emoticons too.

## Objectives

Write a method that will take a traditional Western emoticon, like `:)` and translate it to its Japanese version. Refer to the table below for translations.

|Meaning   | English | Japanese    |
|----------|:-------:|:-----------:|
|angel     |O:)      |☜(⌒▽⌒)☞      |
|angry     |>:(      |ヽ(ｏ`皿′ｏ)ﾉ  |
|bored     |:O       |(ΘεΘ;)       |
|confused  |%)       |(゜.゜)       |
|embarrased|:$       |(#^.^#)      |
|fish      |><>      |>゜))))彡     |
|glasses   | 8D      |(^0_0^)      |
|grining   |=D       |（￣ー￣）     |
|happy     |:)       |（＾ｖ＾）     |
|kiss      |:*       |(*^3^)/~☆     |
|sad       |:'(      |(Ｔ▽Ｔ)       |

|wink      |;)       |(^_-)        |

## Instructions

This is a test-driven lab so just get those specs to pass! The first step will be to load the YAML file in the `lib/` folder. Check out the resources below for help loading a YAML file.
